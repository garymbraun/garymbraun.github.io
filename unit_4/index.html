			<h3>Camilla Shawl</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>From Madder by Carrie Bostick Hodge. In Bumblebirch Cocoon - a 2ply lace weight in silk and merino on size 3 needles. Cast on additional repeats of the shell pattern to make up for the smaller gauge. This was a very fun pattern to knit. It was well written and the lace pattern easy to memorize.</p>

			<h3>Sweater</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>The Nancy Cardigan by Siv Molven Sliper. Knit in Rauma 3 tr. Strikkegarn. A Norwegian cardigan knit in Norwegian yarn. This cardigan was a study of firsts. First full sized stranded color work yolk. First steek. It has a few mistakes knit in - but that doesnâ€™t keep it from being worn as often as possible.</p>

			<h3>Hat</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Salish Toque by Silvia Olsen. Knit in Custom Woolen Mills Ltd Prairie Wool Lopi Soft Spun. This hat was started kit from a class with Silvia Olsen about knitting in the Cowichan style of catching floats. A great technique and I need to knit more from her Knitting with Wool book.</p>

			<h3>Socks</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>These socks were knit for my husband during Sock Madness 2009 (!). This is most definitely a favorite pattern. Knit in Knit Picks Dancing and Risata - these yarns have really held up well as Gary wears them often.  Knit on size 0 needles at 9 1/2 stitches per inch - the tight gauge  really helps the longevity of socks.</p>
