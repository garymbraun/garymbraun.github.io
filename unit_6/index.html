			<p>Like an artesian spring flowing out of a mountain, may our plans to create never cease. 	We have been busy over the years making. From knitting to sewing, quilting, dying, 	embroidery. Whatever tickles our fancy. Knitting is the main idea and most favorite craft.

			<img src="images/Scarf-grey.jpg" alt="shawl" title="Camilla Shawl">
			<h3>Camilla Shawl</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>From Madder by Carrie Bostick Hodge. In Bumblebirch Cocoon - a 2ply lace weight in silk and merino on size 3 needles. Cast on additional repeats of the shell pattern to make up for the smaller gauge. This was a very fun pattern to knit. It was well written and the lace pattern easy to memorize.</p>

			<img src="images/Sweater.jpg" alt="Sweater" title="Nancy Cardigan">
			<h3>Sweater</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>The Nancy Cardigan by Siv Molven Sliper. Knit in Rauma 3 tr. Strikkegarn. A Norwegian cardigan knit in Norwegian yarn. This cardigan was a study of firsts. First full sized stranded color work yolk. First steek. It has a few mistakes knit in - but that doesn’t keep it from being worn as often as possible.</p>

			<img src="images/Blanket.jpg" alt="Blanket" title="Mosaic Baby Blanket">
			<h3>Blanket</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Mosaic Baby Blanket from Purl Bee. Knit in Tosh DK colors Molly Ringwald and Coquette. For Alicen, the newest addition to the Ophus family.</p>

			<img src="images/Hat-zigzag.jpg" alt="hat" title="Salish Toque Hat">
			<h3>Hat</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Salish Toque by Silvia Olsen. Knit in Custom Woolen Mills Ltd Prairie Wool Lopi Soft Spun. This hat was started kit from a class with Silvia Olsen about knitting in the Cowichan style of catching floats. A great technique and I need to knit more from her Knitting with Wool book.</p>

			<img src="images/socks.jpg" alt="Socks" title="Sock Madness">
			<h3>Socks</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>These socks were knit for my husband during Sock Madness 2009 (!). This is most definitely a favorite pattern. Knit in Knit Picks Dancing and Risata - these yarns have really held up well as Gary wears them often.  Knit on size 0 needles at 9 1/2 stitches per inch - the tight gauge  really helps the longevity of socks.</p>

			<img src="images/mittens.jpg" alt="Mittens" title="Colorful Mitten Pattern">
			<h3>Mittens</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Based off of Ruth Sorensen’s Colorful Mitten pattern.  Knit with Noro Kureyon Sock yarn - starting in different sections of the color way.  This color does not have a lot of contrast - but enough to make them interesting.  Just the right weight for around town in the winter in Seattle.</p>
